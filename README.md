# Radioactive Homer

## Intro
This game has the same mechanics and gameplay as the classic 1970s arcade game "Snake" but with a visual style and theme inspired by the iconic tv animation, The Simpsons. The goal is to guide Homer (i.e., the snake) to donuts while avoiding collisions with walls and his own body. But be careful because the donuts are radioactive so Homer's body mutates as he consumes more.
