# Radioactive Homer
<br />

## Intro
This game has the same mechanics and gameplay as the classic Snake game, but with a visual style and theme inspired by the iconic cartoon, The Simpsons.

Similar to the 1970s classic arcade game, the objective is to guide Homer (i.e., the snake) to radioactive donuts while avoiding collisions with walls and with his own body. As Homer consumes more radioactivity, his body mutates by growing longer and by glowing.  

Use arrow keys to direct Homer and change direction. As the game progresses, the snake moves faster
Description of game. Background info about why you chose the game is a nice touch.


Snake game is a classic arcade video game that originated in the late 1970s. The objective of the game is to control a snake on a playing field, guiding it to eat food that randomly appears while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body. As the snake consumes more food, its body grows longer, making it harder to navigate without running into walls or itself.

The game typically has simple graphics and controls, with the player using arrow keys or similar inputs to change the direction of the snake. As the game progresses, the snake moves faster and the playing field becomes more crowded with obstacles, increasing the difficulty level.

The game has been adapted to many platforms, including home consoles, personal computers, and mobile devices, and has remained popular over the years due to its simple yet addictive gameplay.
