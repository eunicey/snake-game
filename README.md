# Radioactive Homer

## Intro
This game has the same mechanics and gameplay as the classic Snake game but with a visual style and theme inspired by the iconic tv cartoon, The Simpsons. The goal is to guide Homer (i.e., the snake) to donuts while avoiding collisions with walls and his own body. The donuts are radioactive, so Homer's body mutates as he consumes more. Use arrow keys to direct Homer and change direction. As the game progresses, Homer's body will lengthen and move faster, which will increase the difficulty level.
